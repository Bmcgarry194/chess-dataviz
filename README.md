------------------------

Quick weekend project to get to know D3 a bit closer.

Scrapes chess24.com for tournament data and displays move evaluation and move times as a graph. Check it out here.

There are two tournaments loaded up, the 2014 World Chess Championship and the 2015 Shamkir Chess Tournament (Gashimov Memorial).

#Usage
1) Use the scraper to get some tournament data. I'm not going to explain this sorry.
2) Open index.html on any static file server & choose the json it created.

#License
Do whatever you want.
